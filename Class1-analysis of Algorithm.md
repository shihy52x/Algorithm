# Reasons to analyze algorithms
- Predict performance
- Compare algorithm
- provide gurantess,
- understand theoratical basis

Primary practical reason: avoid performance bugs: cilents get poor performance becauuse programmer did not understand performance characteristics

### some algorithmic successes
Discrete Fourier transform.
NlogN steps, enables new technology

### N-body simulaiton
NlogN steps, enables new research

### the challenge.
!. will myu program be able to solve a large pratical input?
why is my program so slow? why does it run out of memory
